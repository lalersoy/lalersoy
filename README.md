## Hi and welcome!! 

Below is an overview of the projects I have completed during my studies and professional life. 

| Project Name | Tech | Tools | Description | Link |
|:-------------|:------|:-------|:-------------|:------|
| **Customer Journey & Conversion Dashboard** | **BigQuery**, **Looker Studio**, **SQL** | GA360 Sample Dataset, Google Cloud | An interactive dashboard built using **custom BigQuery SQL queries** on the Google Analytics 360 public dataset. Includes both an executive KPI overview and a full funnel analysis by device type. Built in Looker Studio. | [Looker Dashboard](https://lookerstudio.google.com/reporting/5ba94044-8343-40f2-bf4c-c7770eab143d) |
| **User Retention Analysis (Healthcare SaaS)** | **Python**, **SQL** | Pandas, Matplotlib, PostgreSQL, Seaborn, pgAdmin | Simulates and analyzes user behavior in a fictional healthtech SaaS app to answer: *“Which early behaviors best predict long-term retention?”* Includes retention metrics, cohort analysis, event funnels, and SQL KPIs. | [Repo](https://github.com/lalersoy/user-retention-analysis) |
| **Risk Prediction (Medical Case Study)** | **Python**, Jupyter | **Tableau**, Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-learn | Identifying key **risk factors** for Alzheimer’s and predicting diagnosis using  machine learning models. Performs model comparisons. [This file](https://github.com/lalersoy/alzheimers-disease-prediction/blob/main/alzheimers_to_churn.md) explains how the same approach applies to **churn prediction** in **product analytics**.| [Repo](https://github.com/lalersoy/alzheimers-disease-prediction) • [Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/views/alzheimers-prediction/Dashboard1?:language=en-GB&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link) |
| **Feedback-Driven Recommendation System** | **Python**, Jupyter| Pandas, Scikit-learn, NLTK, Tfidf, SciPy | An **NLP-powered** personalized recommendation system for hotels based on user preferences, sentiment analysis, and text mining techniques. [This file](https://github.com/lalersoy/hotel-recommendation-system/blob/main/review_feedback_product_analytics.md) explains how this applies to **product analytics use cases** like **feature prioritization**. | [Repo](https://github.com/lalersoy/hotel-recommendation-system) |
| **Longitudinal fMRI Study for Chopstick Skill Acquisition** | **MATLAB**, **R**, **Bash**, Perl | **SLURM**, SPM, Marsbar, TDT | Analyzing fMRI data to understand neural adaptations during motor skill learning using support vector machines (SVM). Using **Bash scripting** with **SLURM job scheduling** for high-performance computing (HPC) pipeline automation. | [Repo](https://github.com/lalersoy/masters-thesis) |
| **Causal Inference Modeling – Neuroimaging** | **MATLAB** | SPM | Investigating brain connectivity dynamics using DCM on neuroimaging data. | [Repo](https://github.com/lalersoy/dynamic-causal-modelling) |
